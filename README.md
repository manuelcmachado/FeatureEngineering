# ML Feature Engineering

Creating modules useful for feature engineering your data before feeding it to a **Machine Learning** model using Python as a tool do get the job done.
At this point, the repo has a module that handles missing and duplicate values in a dataset. 

## Content of this Repository:
- feature_engineering.py: Module for handling missing and duplicate features in a dataset.
- feature_engineering_helper.py: As the name suggests, a bunch of functions used by the feature_engineering module.
- testfeature_engineering.py: Runs the module and gives you a sense of how it works.
